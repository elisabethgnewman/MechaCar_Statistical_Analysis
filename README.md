## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Using what we learned in Module 15 about regression analysis, the two variables/coefficients that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg in the dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance. These two variables had p-values less than .05, as shown below.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
